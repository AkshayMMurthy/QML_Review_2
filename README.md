# Quantum Machine Learning for Encrypted Network Traffic Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository explores **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** techniques for analyzing encrypted network traffic using the **ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset**. Various **quantum encoding methods** (Angle, Amplitude, and Basis encoding) are applied to represent network traffic data, followed by training **canonical machine learning models** for classification and anomaly detection.  

## Features  
- **Quantum Encodings**:  
  - **Angle Encoding**: Maps classical features to quantum states using rotational gates.  
  - **Amplitude Encoding**: Utilizes quantum amplitudes to represent data efficiently.  
  - **Basis Encoding**: Assigns classical bits to quantum basis states.  
- **Hybrid QML Workflow**: Combines quantum state preparation with classical learning models for improved pattern recognition.  
- **Dataset**: ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset, preprocessed for quantum feature representation.  

## Installation
